**Basics**

 - Please complete this project alone. 
 - You can search for help on any site, use open-source components, and use other public code with a comment. 
 - The estimation time for this project is a few hours. 
 - **Push changes to your forked repo**
 
 ## Instructions
 1. Fork this repository to your own Github account. 
 2. The code here is a hint on how to get the data with a SignalR client. 
 3. Create a WPF MVVM project under the solution. 
 4. Create  a screen divided into few sections: 
       a. Header - Title.
       b. Configuration - option to select a color for rising stock and a different color for downing stock
       c. A table that will be filled with stocks and update in real-time from the SignalR source.

6. Create a DB and insert 10 last rows per symbole name with the latest changes. Keep it updated.
